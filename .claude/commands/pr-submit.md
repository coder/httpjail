Create a PR for the existing branch.

Keep the PR title and body concise. Use the following title prefixes:

- `fix:` for production code bug fixes
- `perf:` for production code performance improvements
- `feat:` for new features
- `docs:` for documentation improvements (including README.md and CLAUDE.md)
- `ci:` for CI improvements

based on what best describes the changes.

Avoid extraneous emphasis and emojis in the PR body. It should be factual and neutral.

Consider at least:

- Background (if any)
- If fixing bugs, reproduction steps
- Changes to the UX surface area
- Testing approach
- Acknowledged but intentionally ignored issues
